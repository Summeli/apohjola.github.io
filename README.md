# apohjola.com github pages

These are the files the power my personal website at [apohohjola.com](http://apohjola.com).

The site is build using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), with the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo), and Jessica Reels website(http://jreel.github.io/) as a basis.

### Issues / TODOs
Page pagination is not working for some reason.  I really don't blog much, so it's not an urgent fix. In the mean time I'll just edit my _includes/post_list.html manually.
