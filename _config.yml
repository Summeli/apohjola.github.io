# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# # # # Site settings # # # #
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  The personal website of Antti Pohjola
# There is much confusion around the use of the settings for url and baseurl.
# With newest version of Jekyll, you *should* only need to specify baseurl,
#   and that ONLY if your site is hosted under a subdirectory.
#   An example of this would be for GitHub Project pages, hosted at http://YOU.github.io/PROJECT
#   In this case, set the baseurl to "/PROJECT".
#
# For GitHub User pages, hosted at http://YOU.github.io
#  you DO NOT need to include the baseurl (in fact, things will break if you do).
#
# The newest version of Jekyll includes the absolute_url and relative_url filters
#  and I use them in my templates to hopefully make hrefs *just work* no matter what.
#  (By doing that, we shouldn't even need to use site.url in the template at all.)

baseurl:  ""  # empty for GitHub User page; "/your-repo" (NO trailing slash) for Project page
url:  # pretty sure this is auto-set during build, so I'd leave it alone if I were you
